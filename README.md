Description: This repository is used for my simple portfolio site. The site itself was made with `create-react-app`. Additionally, I used Tailwind, craco and react-router-dom.

## On accessibility:

This site was built with accessibility in mind. It has been tested with axe and VoiceOver with 0 issues found, but it has not been user-tested. The header navigation menu's keyboard navigability follows the authoring practices offered by the [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/)
